/**
 * Boundary adapters between the project's loose `LlmMessage` type and
 * pi-ai's strict `Message` type.
 *
 * Why these exist: pi-ai's `Context.messages` is typed `Message[]` with no
 * permissive input variant, and `AssistantMessage` requires response
 * metadata (`api` / `provider` / `model` / `usage` / `stopReason`). Several
 * call sites hold data that is *genuinely* a `Message` at runtime but is
 * typed looser (`unknown` for raw branch entries, `LlmMessage[]` for the
 * pruned pipeline). Rather than scatter blind `as` casts, each boundary
 * upcast lives here with a comment documenting the data's provenance so a
 * reader can verify soundness without re-deriving it.
 *
 * Note: the explore-tool feedback loop does NOT use these — it builds its
 * conversation buffer in native `Message[]` directly (see `phases/explore.ts`),
 * which is the preferred pattern for any new code that talks to a provider.
